# InfluxDB IOx

InfluxDB IOx (short for Iron Oxide, pronounced InfluxDB "eye-ox") is the future core of InfluxDB, an open source time series database.
The name is in homage to Rust, the language this project is written in.
It is built using [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and [DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/02/04/datafusion-donation/) among other things.
InfluxDB IOx aims to be:

* The future core of InfluxDB; supporting industry standard SQL, InfluxQL, and Flux
* An in-memory columnar store using object storage for persistence
* A fast analytic database for structured and semi-structured events (like logs and tracing data)
* A system for defining replication (synchronous, asynchronous, push and pull) and partitioning rules for InfluxDB time series data and tabular analytics data
* A system supporting real-time subscriptions
* A processor that can transform and do arbitrary computation on time series and event data as it arrives
* An analytic database built for data science, supporting Apache Arrow Flight for fast data transfer

Persistence is through Parquet files in object storage.
It is a design goal to support integration with other big data systems through object storage and Parquet specifically.

For more details on the motivation behind the project and some of our goals, read through the [InfluxDB IOx announcement blog post](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/announcing-influxdb-iox/).
If you prefer a video that covers a little bit of InfluxDB history and high level goals for [InfluxDB IOx you can watch Paul Dix's announcement talk from InfluxDays NA 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnwkAAyMp18).

## Supported Platforms

As we commit to support platforms they will be added here.
Our current goal is that the following platforms will be able to run InfluxDB IOx.

* Linux x86 (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`)
* Darwin x86 (`x86_64-apple-darwin`)
* Darwin arm (`aarch64-apple-darwin`)

This list is very unlikely to be complete; we will add more platforms based on
our ability to support them effectively.

## Project Status

This project is very early and in active development. It isn't yet ready for testing, which is why we're not producing builds or documentation yet.

If you would like contact the InfluxDB IOx developers,
join the [InfluxData Community Slack](https://influxdata.com/slack) and look for the #influxdb_iox channel.

We're also hosting monthly tech talks and community office hours on the project on the 2nd Wednesday of the month at 8:30 AM Pacific Time.

### Install dependencies

To compile and run InfluxDB IOx from source, you'll need the following:

* [Rust](#rust)
* [Clang](#clang)
* [lld (on Linux)](#lld)
* [protoc (on Apple Silicon)](#protoc)
* [Postgres](#postgres)

#### Rust

The easiest way to install Rust is to use [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/), a Rust version manager.
Follow the instructions for your operating system on the `rustup` site.

`rustup` will check the [`rust-toolchain`](./rust-toolchain.toml) file and automatically install and use the correct Rust version for you.

#### Clang

Building InfluxDB IOx requires `clang` (for the [`croaring`] dependency).
Check for `clang` by running `clang --version`.

```shell
clang --version
Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.27)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin20.1.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
```

If `clang` is not already present, it can typically be installed with the system package manager.

[`croaring`]: https://github.com/saulius/croaring-rs

#### lld

If you are building InfluxDB IOx on Linux then you will need to ensure you have installed the `lld` LLVM linker.
Check if you have already installed it by running `lld -version`.

```shell
lld -version
lld is a generic driver.
Invoke ld.lld (Unix), ld64.lld (macOS), lld-link (Windows), wasm-ld (WebAssembly) instead
```

If `lld` is not already present, it can typically be installed with the system package manager.

#### protoc

Prost no longer bundles a `protoc` binary.
For instructions on how to install `protoc`, refer to the [official gRPC documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/).

IOx should then build correctly.

#### Postgres

The catalog is stored in Postgres (unless you're running in ephemeral mode). Postgres can be installed via Homebrew:

```shell
brew install postgres
```

then follow the instructions for starting Postgres either at system startup or on-demand.

### Clone the repository

Clone this repository using `git`.
If you use the `git` command line, this looks like:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:influxdata/influxdb_iox.git
```

Then change into the directory containing the code:

```shell
cd influxdb_iox
```

The rest of these instructions assume you are in this directory.

### Configure the server

InfluxDB IOx can be configured using either environment variables or a configuration file,
making it suitable for deployment in containerized environments.

For a list of configuration options, run `influxdb_iox --help`.
For configuration options for specific subcommands, run `influxdb_iox <subcommand> --help`.

To use a configuration file, use a `.env` file in the working directory.
See the provided [example configuration file](docs/env.example).
To use the example configuration file, run:

```shell
cp docs/env.example .env
```

### Compiling and Running

InfluxDB IOx is built using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool.

To compile for development, run:

```shell
cargo build
```

This creates a binary at `target/debug/influxdb_iox`.

### Build a Docker image (optional)

Building the Docker image requires:

* Docker 18.09+
* BuildKit

To [enable BuildKit] by default, set `{ "features": { "buildkit": true } }` in the Docker engine configuration,
or run `docker build` with`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`

To build the Docker image:

```shell
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build .
```

[Enable BuildKit]: https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#to-enable-buildkit-builds

#### Ephemeral mode

To start InfluxDB IOx and store data in memory, after you've compiled for development, run:

```shell
./target/debug/influxdb_iox run all-in-one
```

By default this runs an "all-in-one" server with HTTP server on port `8080`,  router gRPC server on port `8081` and querier gRPC server on port `8082`. When the server is stopped all data lost.

#### Local persistence mode

To start InfluxDB IOx and store the catalog in Postgres and data in the local filesystem to persist
data across restarts, after you've compiled for development, run:

```shell
./target/debug/influxdb_iox run all-in-one --catalog-dsn postgres:///iox_shared --data-dir=~/iox_data
```

where `--catalog-dsn` is a connection URL to the Postgres database you wish to use, and
`--data-dir` is the directory you wish to use.

Note that when the server is stopped all data that has not yet been written to parquet files will be lost.


#### Compile and run

Rather than building and running the binary in `target`, you can also compile and run with one
command:

```shell
cargo run -- run all-in-one
```

#### Release mode for performance testing

To compile for performance testing, build in release mode then use the binary in `target/release`:

```shell
cargo build --release
./target/release/influxdb_iox run all-in-one
```

You can also compile and run in release mode with one step:

```shell
cargo run --release -- run all-in-one
```

#### Running tests

You can run tests using:

```shell
cargo test --all
```

See  [docs/testing.md] for more information


### Write and read data

Data can be written to InfluxDB IOx by sending [line protocol] format to the `/api/v2/write` endpoint or using the CLI.

For example, assuming you are running in local mode, this command will send data in the `test_fixtures/lineproto/metrics.lp` file to the `company_sensors` database.

```shell
./target/debug/influxdb_iox -vv write company_sensors test_fixtures/lineproto/metrics.lp --host http://localhost:8081
```

Note that `--host http://localhost:8081` is required because the router and query services run on different gRPC ports and the CLI defaults to the querier's port, `8082`.

To query the data stored in the `company_sensors` database:

```shell
./target/debug/influxdb_iox query company_sensors "SELECT * FROM cpu LIMIT 10"
```

### Use the CLI

InfluxDB IOx is packaged as a binary with commands to start the IOx server,
as well as a CLI interface for interacting with and configuring such servers.

The CLI itself is documented via built-in help which you can access by running `influxdb_iox --help`

### Use InfluxDB 2.0 API compatibility

InfluxDB IOx allows seamless interoperability with InfluxDB 2.0.

Where InfluxDB 2.0 stores data in organizations and buckets,
InfluxDB IOx stores data in _namespaces_.
IOx maps `organization` and `bucket` pairs to namespaces  with the two parts separated by an underscore (`_`):
`organization_bucket`.

Here's an example using [`curl`] to send data into the `company_sensors` namespace using the InfluxDB 2.0 `/api/v2/write` API:

```shell
curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v2/write?org=company&bucket=sensors" --data-binary @test_fixtures/lineproto/metrics.lp
```

[line protocol]: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/reference/syntax/line-protocol/
[`curl`]: https://curl.se/

### Run health checks

The HTTP API exposes a healthcheck endpoint at `/health`

```console
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
OK
```

The gRPC API implements the [gRPC Health Checking Protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md).
This can be tested with [`grpc-health-probe`](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe):

```console
$ grpc_health_probe -addr 127.0.0.1:8082 -service influxdata.platform.storage.Storage
status: SERVING
```

### Manually call the gRPC API

To manually invoke one of the gRPC APIs, use a gRPC CLI client such as [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl).

Tonic (the gRPC server library we're using) currently doesn't have support for gRPC reflection, hence you must pass all `.proto` files to your client.
You can find a convenient `grpcurl` wrapper that does that in the `scripts` directory:

```console
$ ./scripts/grpcurl -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8082 list
grpc.health.v1.Health
influxdata.iox.management.v1.ManagementService
influxdata.platform.storage.IOxTesting
influxdata.platform.storage.Storage
$ ./scripts/grpcurl -plaintext 127.0.0.1:8082 influxdata.iox.management.v1.ManagementService.ListDatabases
{
  "names": [
    "foobar_weather"
  ]
}
```
